ðŸ§¾**Description:** For a master's thesis project, this data set was gathered from Addis Abeba Sub-City Police Departments. The data set was created using manual records of the year 2017â€“20's traffic accidents. During data encoding, all sensitive information was eliminated, leaving 32 characteristics and 12316 instances of the accident. Following preprocessing, it is examined using various machine learning classification techniques in order to determine the main reasons of the accident.

**Problem Statement:** The feature that has to be changed is the multi-class variable **Accident severity**. By working through each day's job, the goal is to categorise this variable based on the other 31 qualities step-by-step. Your evaluation will be based on your **f1-score**.
